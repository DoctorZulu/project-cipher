--User Story--

1. -Fade in- You receive an email from your boss, you are a member of a dev team at a cookie cutter looking modern website. The site has been hacked, and you are tasked to regain control. The hacker, uninterested in financial compensation is just doing this for the thrills. Clues, puzzles, and ciphers have been hidden and scattered accross the now disabled and compromised website. Can you crack the code before time runs out and the website is lost forever? Moreoever, who is this mysterious hacker, and what is their end-goal?

2. The player will have free access to multiple resources on their corrupted website. There is an "admin console" that will hide clues to follow and eventually unlock a keyphrase that will result in aborting the countdown. Clues and puzzles may be hidden anywhere, including in cookies, HTML, or elsewhere. Additionally the user may have to navigate outside of the website entirely in order to figure out the next steps. 

3. The game is intended to be a much shorter and smaller in scope version of the mysterious Cicada 3301 experience. Users will have to register/sign up which will fulfill CRUD functionality. Their "profile" page will track progress in the game and will be public to other users who are interested in racing to the finish.
